## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- (Optional) A virtual environment manager (venv, conda, etc.)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/traccia.git
   cd traccia
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install in editable mode with development dependencies
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   
   # Or if dev dependencies aren't configured:
   pip install -e .
   pip install pytest pytest-cov ruff mypy black
   ```

5. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import traccia; print(traccia.__version__)"
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** - Write code, add tests, update documentation

3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest traccia/tests/ -v
   ```

4. **Check code style**:
   ```bash
   ruff check traccia/
   ruff format traccia/ --check
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: description of your changes"
   ```

   Use clear, descriptive commit messages. We follow conventional commits:
   - `Add:` for new features
   - `Fix:` for bug fixes
   - `Update:` for updates to existing features
   - `Refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `Docs:` for documentation changes
   - `Test:` for test additions or changes

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and return types
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions, classes, and methods
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Formatting

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check for issues
ruff check traccia/

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check traccia/ --fix

# Format code
ruff format traccia/
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints throughout the codebase:

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any, List

def process_data(
    data: Dict[str, Any],
    options: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process data with optional configuration."""
    ...
```

### Docstrings

Follow Google-style docstrings:

```python
def init(
    api_key: Optional[str] = None,
    endpoint: Optional[str] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> TracerProvider:
    """
    Initialize the Traccia SDK.
    
    Args:
        api_key: API key for authentication (optional)
        endpoint: OTLP endpoint URL (optional)
        **kwargs: Additional configuration options
        
    Returns:
        TracerProvider instance
        
    Raises:
        ConfigError: If configuration is invalid
        
    Example:
        >>> from traccia import init
        >>> provider = init(api_key="your-key")
    """
    ...
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest traccia/tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest traccia/tests/test_config.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest traccia/tests/ --cov=traccia --cov-report=html

# Run tests in watch mode (if pytest-watch installed)
ptw traccia/tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain what they test
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test both success and error cases

Example:

```python
def test_init_with_config_file(tmp_path):
    """Test that init() loads configuration from file."""
    # Arrange
    config_file = tmp_path / "traccia.toml"
    config_file.write_text("[tracing]\napi_key = 'test-key'")
    
    # Act
    provider = init(config_file=str(config_file))
    
    # Assert
    assert provider is not None
    # Add more assertions
```

### Test Organization

- Unit tests go in `traccia/tests/`
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Group related tests in classes when appropriate
- Use fixtures for common setup
